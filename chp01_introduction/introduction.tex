\chapter{Introduction}
Differential equations are used ubitiquously to model, predict, and nderstand many different phenomena across a broad range of contexts.


\td{Make this introduction more general, less fancy words}
Many phenomena across geophysical, biological and socio-economic applications can be modelled using a continuous-time dynamical system, i.e., an ordinary differential equation \cite[e.g.]{BrauerCastillo-Chavez_2012_MathematicalModelsPopulation,TelEtAl_2005_ChemicalBiologicalActivity,Wiggins_2005_DynamicalSystemsApproach}.
Given initial values of a multi-dimensional state variable, such equations can be solved numerically to predict the state at future times.
The governing dynamics may be specified using existing phenomenological models, but in modern applications these are usually supplemented or driven by observed data \cite{LawEtAl_2015_DataAssimilationMathematical,ReichCotter_2015_ProbabilisticForecastingBayesian}.
Standard examples include the modelling of weather using available data \cite{LawEtAl_2015_DataAssimilationMathematical,ReichCotter_2015_ProbabilisticForecastingBayesian}, and predicting concentrations of, for instance, temperature, pollutants or phytoplankton in the ocean using observed current velocity data \cite{AbascalEtAl_2009_ApplicationHFRadar,dOvidioEtAl_2010_FluidDynamicalNiches}.

These models are usually specified in a purely \emph{deterministic} fashion, so that each component is treated as being known exactly.
The model provides for a given initial condition, one prediction of the future state.
However, in any modelling scenario, there will inevitably be uncertainty in the model specification.
The possible sources of uncertainty include, but are not limited to:
\begin{itemize}
	\item the model is sourced from measured data, which itself includes observational error.
	\item information only being available on a spatiotemporal grid (resolution error).
	\item a lack of a complete understanding of all the phenomena and processes involved.
	\item imperfect knowledge of the initial conditions.
\end{itemize}
There are two primary manifestations of this uncertainty: in the initial state, and in the ongoing evolution of the model itself.
In weather and climate modelling, resolution issues pose a significant challenge in producing accurate predictions.
Many such prediction models rely upon a spatial discretisation for tractable analysis and simulation.
Often, an extremely high resolution is needed to produce accurate simulations and predictions; for example, \citet{DawsonEtAl_2012_SimulatingRegimeStructures} demonstrated such requirements\lb{Read paper and be specific about numbers} for the state-of-the-art European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) forecast model.
\Cref{fig:subgrid_effects} depicts how features (represented by the grey structure) in a model can be missed when a model (given as vectors in red) is only known at points on a finite grid (black points).


One approach to accounting for these sources of uncertainty is by replacing the deterministic model with a \emph{stochastic} one, where the uncertainty is introduced as an inherit part of the model and the solutions are treated as random quantities.
\td{Flow more neatly into \emph{stochastic} models}
The formal introduction of stochastic terms to account for unknown and unresolved processes into an otherwise deterministic model is known as \emph{stochastic parameterisation}, particularly in scientific circles.
\citet{BernerEtAl_2017_StochasticParameterizationNew} review the need for stochastic parameterisation in weather and climate models and discuss how stochastic terms can quantify four different aspects of these models:
\begin{itemize}
	\item directly estimating uncertainty,
	\item reducing systematic model errors arising from unresolved subgrid processes,
	\item triggering regime changes, and
	\item encapsulating the effect of external forcing.
\end{itemize}
\citet{DawsonPalmer_2015_SimulatingWeatherRegimes} showed through simulation studies that the performance of a high-resolution purely deterministic model can be matched by a lower-resolution stochastic model.
Stochastic parameterisation is also employed in oceanographic modelling, where unresolved motion from subgrid-scale eddies and turbulence are modelled as stochastic noise \citep{Griffa_1996_ApplicationsStochasticParticle,BerloffMcWilliams_2002_MaterialTransportOceanic}.
\td{Flow from here into the need for maths - justifications, proofs, etc.?}
There is an emerging need to bridge the gap between mathematicians working on developing stochastic theory and algorithms, and the scientists looking to apply this work to their respective fields.
In particular, \citet{BernerEtAl_2017_StochasticParameterizationNew} conclude that ``geoscientists are often unaware of mathematically rigorous results that can aid in the development of physically relevant parameterizations, [while] mathematicians often do not know about open issues in scientific applications that might be mathematically tractable''.
\td{Write a better segue}
Stochastic differential equations (SDEs) are a natural framework for introducing different sources of uncertainty into the continuous time evolution of a variable \citep{Oksendal_2003_StochasticDifferentialEquations,SarkkaSolin_2019_AppliedStochasticDifferential,KallianpurSundar_2014_StochasticAnalysisDiffusion}.
The uncertainty is introduced as a (possibly time- and state-dependent) stochastic process that contributes to the ongoing evolution of the state variable.
The solution is now itself a random quantity, in that at a given time, rather than predicting a single value for the state, the stochastic solution gives a probability distribution\lb{Can improve these two sentences}.
Although an SDE allows us to account for sources of uncertainty in the model, the usage of such an equation presents new challenges, first requiring an entirely new type of calculus to formulate \citep{Ito_1944_StochasticIntegral,Ito_1946_StochasticIntegralEquation}.
Finding exact solutions is almost always impossible, and working with the equations and their solutions analytically is more difficult than for the deterministic counterparts.
Nevertheless, stochastic differential equations are used across a range of fields, including in financial mathematics \citehere, biological modelling \citep[e.g.]{PreislerEtAl_2004_ModelingAnimalMovements,another}, physics \citep[e.g.]{StraussEffenberger_2017_HitchhikerGuideStochastic,GardinerEtAl_1992_WavefunctionQuantumStochastic,another}, atmospheric modelling \citehere, and oceanography \citep{BerloffMcWilliams_2002_MaterialTransportOceanic}.
Note that there are several different formulations of stochastic calculus, which are related by certain transformations of the resulting SDEs.
We focus our attention solely on It\^o SDEs, with the understanding that our results may be applied to other formulations via the appropriate transformation.
Generally, in modelling situations the dynamics are highly nonlinear and one expects the noise to vary with both time and state (i.e. the noise can be \emph{multiplicative}), e.g. in atmospheric \citep{SuraEtAl_2005_MultiplicativeNoiseNonGaussianity,Sura_2003_StochasticAnalysisSouthern} and oceanic \citep{KamenkovichEtAl_2015_PropertiesOriginsAnisotropic} systems and from experimental and observational considerations.
This further complicates usage of the model for prediction and analysis; such SDEs are intractable to solve analytically and computationally expensive to approximate accurately.
Data-based models---that is, models possessing terms in the equations which are driven by data rather than by explicitly specified functions---and uncertainty in the initial state render additional problems in obtaining a theoretical understanding of the stochastic system.
Nonetheless, bulk stochastic (also known as Monte-Carlo) simulation of these models is the gold standard in many applications, most notably climate modelling where large-scale ensemble predictions are used \citep{Collins_2007_EnsemblesProbabilitiesNew,LeutbecherEtAl_2017_StochasticRepresentationsModel}.

Despite the availability of Monte-Carlo solutions to complicated stochastic models, the most significant drawback of this approach in practice is the computational cost.
In general, a large number of samples is required for convergent statistics and accurate inference, and often generating representative realisations of the models reaches the lmit of our computational capabilities.
Overcoming this significant limitation is an are aof ongoing research in \emph{every} field in which such stochastic models are used.
For example, the recent review by \citet{LeutbecherEtAl_2017_StochasticRepresentationsModel} highlights the need to develop computationally efficient schemes for quantifying stochasticity in weather and climate forecast models.
In particular, the authors state that ```the aim of current and future developments in stochastic representations of model uncertainty is to develop schemes that are computationally highly efficient and contribute only moderately to the overall computational cost...''.

Let us consider this problem from a mathematical perspective, we are given a possibly highly nonlinear SDE with non-trivial noise components
We cannot solve such equations analytically, and numerical simulation is computationally expensive.
The overall aim of this thesis is to address this difficulty by developing computationally efficient characterisations of uncertainty and algorithms for approximating the probability distributions of the solution (as opposed to just generating samples).
We aim to take advantage of the computational ease of generating solutions to a deterministic system relative to taking many samples of a stochastic one.

In lieu of an exact solution, a common approach to characterising and approximating the solution of nonlinear SDEs with small noise is via a ``linearisation'' through time about a single deterministic trajectory.
A linearised stochastic differential equation, obtained by truncating Taylor expansions of each coefficient \citep[e.g.]{Jazwinski_2014_StochasticProcessesFiltering,Blagoveshchenskii_1962_DiffusionProcessesDepending}, can be solved analytically and is accordingly used across a diversity of literature and applications \citep{Jazwinski_2014_StochasticProcessesFiltering,SarkkaSolin_2019_AppliedStochasticDifferential,KaszasHaller_2020_UniversalUpperEstimate,ArchambeauEtAl_2007_GaussianProcessApproximations,Sanz-AlonsoStuart_2017_GaussianApproximationsSmall,LawEtAl_2015_DataAssimilationMathematical,ReichCotter_2015_ProbabilisticForecastingBayesian,BudhirajaEtAl_2019_AssimilatingDataModels}.
However, often these linearisations are applied without rigorous justification and a clear understanding of \emph{how} the linearisation relates to the nonlinear SDE.
This is particularly the case when the noise is multiplicative, which is a situation that is often ignored but necessary in practice.
In addition, there is little understanding of the impact of the choice of initialisation of the deterministic trajectory on the validity of the linearisation.



\td{Motivate the \emph{qualitative} features that come from these stochastic systems - make LCSs relevant?}
Even when the solutions themselves to the stochastic systems are not available, it can be useful to garner a \emph{qualitative} understanding of the system.

\citet{Balasuriya_2020_StochasticSensitivityComputable} introduce the notion that spatial regions for which the overall uncertainty is small can correspond to coherent structures within the flow.


Although computationally efficient, the Gaussian approximations arising from SDE linearisations are limited in the features which they can capture: multimodality, skewness, and nonlinear correlations\lb{Is this the right term for whackiness in the joint densities??} are commonly observed in practice \citep{SuraEtAl_2005_MultiplicativeNoiseNonGaussianity,BraccoEtAl_2000_VelocityProbabilityDensity,del-Castillo-Negrete_1998_AsymmetricTransportNonGaussian}, but cannot be captured by a single Gaussian component alone.


\section{Contributions of this thesis}
In \Cref{ch:background}, we provide a brief background on stochastic differential equations and the tools we will use.
The remainder of the thesis, and the contributions each chapter provides, are as follows:
\td{The following is possibly too specific/technical for this introduction.}
\begin{itemize}
	\item In \Cref{ch:linear_theory}, we address a deficiency in the \emph{theory} of SDE linearisations. %by providing an explicit bound on the strong error between a stochastic differential equation and an appropriate linearisation, capturing the impact of \emph{both} the ongoing linearisation and the choice of initial condition.
	      The aim here is to provide a rigorously justified framework for computing efficient approximations of nonlinear stochastic differential equations, subject to arbitrary and random initial conditions.
	      Much of the content in this chapter and the following \Cref{ch:linear_numerics} has been submitted for review as a research article to \emph{Communications in Mathematical Sciences} \citep{BlakeEtAl_2023_ConvergenceStochasticDifferential}.
	      This chapter is the primary theoretical contribution of this thesis, and includes:

	      \begin{itemize}
		      \item We first build upon previous studies of small-noise expansions \cite[e.g.]{Sanz-AlonsoStuart_2017_GaussianApproximationsSmall,Blagoveshchenskii_1962_DiffusionProcessesDepending,FreidlinWentzell_1998_RandomPerturbationsDynamical} to provide an direct proof of a bound on the error between the solution to an SDE and a corresponding linearisation about a deterministic trajectory.
		            Our result holds for a multidimensional and fully-nonautonomous SDE with multiplicative noise subject to an arbitrary initial condition, and the bound itself is written explicitly in terms of the scales of the uncertainty in the initial condition and the ongoing noise.


		            % Be clear here. Two sentences - often lacks justification, OR when the justification is there, only additive or autonomous. "Albeit"
		            % The Gaussian distribution solving the linearised SDE appears in other literature and applications but often lacks justification \cite{Jazwinski_2014_StochasticProcessesFiltering, SarkkaSolin_2019_AppliedStochasticDifferential}.
		            % On the other hand, when the linearisation is justified, this is disregarding time-dependence in the coefficients and multiplicative noise \cite{Sanz-AlonsoStuart_2017_GaussianApproximationsSmall}.

		      \item By providing explicit solutions to the lienarised SDE, we provide in a single place a framework for efficiently computing the solution, enable efficient approximation and characterisation of the nonlinear SDE without resorting to bulk Monte-Carlo simulation.
		            Such an approximation used across a range of literature and applications \citep{Jazwinski_2014_StochasticProcessesFiltering,SarkkaSolin_2019_AppliedStochasticDifferential,KaszasHaller_2020_UniversalUpperEstimate,ArchambeauEtAl_2007_GaussianProcessApproximations,Sanz-AlonsoStuart_2017_GaussianApproximationsSmall,LawEtAl_2015_DataAssimilationMathematical,ReichCotter_2015_ProbabilisticForecastingBayesian,BudhirajaEtAl_2019_AssimilatingDataModels} but is dispersed across many different sources and often stated without an explicit justification.
		            By considering a general nonlinear SDE, we are able to provide a single framework for computing such approximations.
		            \td{Need to rework this dotpoint}

		            % The solution of the linearisation is expressed as an independent sum of the transformed initial condition and the ongoing
		            % In \Cref{thm:limit_moments}, the mean and covariance of the linearisation are written in terms of the diffusion term and gradients of \emph{either} the drift term (as a pair of ordinary differential equations consistent with that arising elsewhere \cite[e.g.]{Jazwinski_2014_StochasticProcessesFiltering, Sanz-AlonsoStuart_2017_GaussianApproximationsSmall, SarkkaSolin_2019_AppliedStochasticDifferential, ArchambeauEtAl_2007_GaussianProcessApproximations}), or the flow map of the corresponding deterministic system.
		            % The latter is an alternative characterisation that allows the Gaussian distribution to be computed \emph{entirely from the solution dynamics} of a deterministic model and specification of any multiplicative noise effects known prior.

		      \item In \Cref{sec:theory_s2}, we use the linearisation framework to extend the notion of ``stochastic sensitivity'' first introduced by \citet{Balasuriya_2020_StochasticSensitivityComputable}, which seeks to explicitly quantify the impact of vector field uncertainty on the solution trajectories of dynamical systems \citep{BranickiUda_2021_LagrangianUncertaintyQuantification,KaszasHaller_2020_UniversalUpperEstimate,BranickiUda_2023_PathBasedDivergenceRates,Balibrea-IniestaEtAl_2016_LagrangianDescriptorsStochastic}.
		            Whereas previously the definition of stochastic sensitivity was restricted to two-dimensions \citep{Balasuriya_2020_StochasticSensitivityComputable}, we provide a new definition in arbitrary dimensions and prove a convenient expression for computation.
		            This is the second significant theoretical contribution of this work, enabling this new tool to be applied to a much broader class of models.

	      \end{itemize}

	\item In \Cref{ch:linear_numerics}, we validate the results of \Cref{sec:theory} using stochastic simulations from a 2-dimensional model.
	      In particular, we demonstrate that the first four moments of the distance between the realisations and the Gaussian limit follow the predicted bound.
	      We also illustrate a key prediction from \Cref{sec:theory_s2}; that the computable covariance matrix of the Gaussian limit captures the time-evolution of uncertainty, even when the noise is multiplicative.

	\item In \Cref{ch:gmm}, we outline an algorithm that employs the linearisation approximation to construct a Gaussian mixture model for the solution to a stochastic differential equation, which can capture non-Gaussianity while still being efficient to compute.
	      The algorithm is preliminary, with several implementation details deliberately left vague and warranting further development.
	      However, we demonstrate the potential of such an approach on examples in the following chapter.

	\item In \Cref{ch:appls}, we apply the tools developed in \Cref{ch:linear_theory,ch:gmm} to two examples constructed from observed data: the position of a sea surface drifter and a 5-dimensional compartmental model for an outbreak of Ebola.
	      The latter example arises from a different context---stochastic models on a discrete state space---where linearised stochastic differential equations arise from large-population limits \citep{Kurtz_1970_SolutionsOrdinaryDifferential,Kurtz_1971_LimitTheoremsSequences}.
	      We explain how these results imply that the theory we develop for stochastic differential equations can be applied to these models, opening up a whole new range of applications, particularly in mathematical biology and epidemiology.

	\item In \Cref{ch:outlook}, we conclude this thesis by discussing the possible applications and future extensions of our work.
	      Since our theory is reasonably general, and we have only outlined a mixture model algorithm, there is much scope for theoretical extension, further numerical investigation, and application to a range of models.
	      In the final chapter, we briefly discuss many of these possible future directions.

%%%%% DUMP OF PAPER CONTEXTS
%, as a scalar measure of uncertainty about any solution trajectory of the deterministic model.
% This also extends stochastic sensitivity as a means of Lagrangian coherent structure extraction to fluid flows of arbitrary dimension.
% Moreover, by additionally accounting for initial condition uncertainty, we are able to relate stochastic sensitivity to the finite-time Lyapunov exponent (FTLE) \cite{ShaddenEtAl_2005_DefinitionPropertiesLagrangian,YouLeung_2021_ComputingFiniteTime,GuoEtAl_2016_FiniteTimeLyapunovExponents,Balasuriya_2020_UncertaintyFinitetimeLyapunov}.


% \rev{Finally, \citet{Sanz-AlonsoStuart_2017_GaussianApproximationsSmall} only consider two forms of initial conditions to the stochastic differential equation -- fixed values and Gaussian distributions -- whereas we provide a more general framework.}

% In general, however, a rigorous justification (in the sense of a limit, say) of such Gaussian approximations is lacking \cite{Sanz-AlonsoStuart_2017_GaussianApproximationsSmall} when the SDE includes \emph{both} time-dependent coefficients and multiplicative noise.
% A natural theoretical approach in the limit of small noise is to use a linearisation process for the SDE, reducing the otherwise analytically intractable SDE to a solvable linear one.
% Within the perspective of determining an uncertainty distribution for a prediction, though, such a linearisation has not been rigorously justified \cite{Sanz-AlonsoStuart_2017_GaussianApproximationsSmall}.
% Other approaches first assume a Gaussian distribution (again, without justification), and obtain formal computations for its mean and covariance \cite{SarkkaSolin_2019_AppliedStochasticDifferential}.
% \sab{Perhaps make a direct quotation here about the fact that this is not justified}

% We remedy these issues in this paper by developing an exact expression for a stochastic process such that solutions to the noisy SDE converge to this process in a precise fashion in the limit of small noise: notably, the expectation of the $ r $th mean of the difference between these converges at a rate of the $ r $th power of the noise parameter for any finite time for all $ r \ge 1 $ (see \Cref{thm:main}).


% In this paper, we build upon this previous work to provide an \emph{explicit bound} (see \cref{eqn:main_ineq} in \Cref{thm:main}) on every moment of the distance between the solution of an SDE and that of a linearisation about a chosen deterministic trajectory.
% We consider a general class of multidimensional SDEs with fully non-autonomous terms and multiplicative noise, and an arbitrary random initial condition following a specified distribution.
% Our bound is written in terms of the scale of ongoing noise and the uncertainty in the initial condition.


% We focus our attention on the first-order series expansion -- that is, a linearisation -- since this is the highest-order such term with an analytical solution \cite{Blagoveshchenskii_1962_DiffusionProcessesDepending}.
% This aim is motivated by the need for computationally efficient uncertainty quantification in climate applications \cite{BernerEtAl_2017_StochasticParameterizationNew,LeutbecherEtAl_2017_StochasticRepresentationsModel,Palmer_2019_StochasticWeatherClimate}, and more broadly dynamical systems \cite{Balasuriya_2020_StochasticSensitivityComputable,KaszasHaller_2020_UniversalUpperEstimate,BranickiUda_2021_LagrangianUncertaintyQuantification}.
% We consider a framework in which the distribution of the initial condition is known, which is a situation that arises, for example, in data assimilation \cite{BudhirajaEtAl_2019_AssimilatingDataModels,Jazwinski_2014_StochasticProcessesFiltering,LawEtAl_2015_DataAssimilationMathematical,ReichCotter_2015_ProbabilisticForecastingBayesian}.


% % For instance, one can formally ``linearise'' the SDE in some sense to obtain a Gaussian density, and this approach is used in filtering theory \cite{Jazwinski_2014_StochasticProcessesFiltering}.
% % Other approaches first assume a Gaussian distribution and obtain computations for its mean and covariance \cite{SarkkaSolin_2019_AppliedStochasticDifferential,ArchambeauEtAl_2007_GaussianProcessApproximations}.
% % However, both approaches lack rigorous justification and a precise understanding of \emph{how} the Gaussian distribution arises from the nonlinear SDE.

% % \begin{itemize}
% %     % \item A linearisation approach is common to approximate an analytically intractable SDE with a solvable linear one. Cite some examples in the literature of where it is used .

% %     % \item Formal linearisations of stochastic differential equations have been studied in the context of small-noise series expansions \cite{Blagoveshchenskii_1962_DiffusionProcessesDepending} and using large deviations theory \cite{FreidlinWentzell_1998_RandomPerturbationsDynamical}.

% %     \item Sanz-Alonso and Stuart provide an explicit bound on the KL-divergence, etc. Limited models, etc. Multiplactive noise, only in terms of KL-divergence, etc.

% %     \item Here, we build upon this work by providing an explicit proof for a general class of SDEs with multiplicative noise, nonautonomous terms, providing a strong error bouud written explicitly in terms of bounding and Lipschitz. This provides conditions on the initialisation of the linearisation under which the solution to the SDE converges, in the sense of a small noise limit.
% %     We show that \emph{all} moments converge towards those of the linearised solution.

% %     \item We also highlight that in the special case of a fixed or Gaussian initial condition, our results reduce to those used in Gaussian approximations \cite{SarkkaSolin_2019_AppliedStochasticDifferential,ArchambeauEtAl_2007_GaussianProcessApproximations,Jazwinski_2014_StochasticProcessesFiltering}
% % \end{itemize}



% In particular, this work fits in with recent interest in stochastic parameterisation as a means to account for unresolved subgrid effects in climate modelling \cite{BernerEtAl_2017_StochasticParameterizationNew,LeutbecherEtAl_2017_StochasticRepresentationsModel,Palmer_2019_StochasticWeatherClimate}.
% In particular, the recent review \cite{LeutbecherEtAl_2017_StochasticRepresentationsModel} concludes, ``The aim of current and future developments in stochastic representations of model uncertainty is to develop schemes that are computationally highly efficient and contribute only moderately to the overall computational cost...''.
% This paper provides one method to convert a stochastic parameterisation (formulated as a SDE) to a computationally cheaper set of coupled ODEs for the mean and variance of an approximate Gaussian, together with a convergence proof and error estimates.

% % The Gaussian distribution arises as the solution to a formal linearisation of the SDE about a deterministic trajectory (in the absence of noise).
% % By bounding all raw moments of the difference between the SDE and the linearised solutions by the noise scale (see \Cref{thm:main}), we show that the stochastic deviation converges in distribution to a multivariate Gaussian random variable (see \Cref{thm:gauss_dist}).

% An important special case arises when the initial condition is fixed, or follows a specified Gaussian distribution.
% providing a computable Gaussian distribution that is consistent with approximations seen in other literature \cite{Sanz-AlonsoStuart_2017_GaussianApproximationsSmall,SarkkaSolin_2019_AppliedStochasticDifferential}, and in particular filtering theory \cite{Jazwinski_2014_StochasticProcessesFiltering}.
% The covariance matrix characterising this Gaussian can be explicitly written in terms of the flow map of the underlying deterministic system and the (potentially spatio-temporally varying) diffusion matrix, and is available even if the deterministic model is only available via data.
% The Gaussian distribution is consistent with that seen in other literature \cite{Jazwinski_2014_StochasticProcessesFiltering, Sanz-AlonsoStuart_2017_GaussianApproximationsSmall, SarkkaSolin_2019_AppliedStochasticDifferential}, while we additionally show convergence of \emph{all} the moments of the deviation distribution.
% The results hold independently of the initial condition and for all finite times; the uncertainty evolution of any deterministic trajectory with time is therefore encapsulated in our results.





% In the absence of any other understanding of these multitudinous issues, a well-established way of tackling such uncertainties in the model is to think of these as stochastic \cite{BernerEtAl_2017_StochasticParameterizationNew,Oksendal_2003_StochasticDifferentialEquations}.
% Running many realisations of stochastic perturbations to the deterministic model can generate statistics to improve predictions and estimate their associated uncertainties \cite[e.g.]{BadzaEtAl_2023_HowSensitiveAre,Collins_2007_EnsemblesProbabilitiesNew}.
% However, in practice a very large number of simulations is necessary to generate convergent statistics \cite{FepponLermusiaux_2018_DynamicallyOrthogonalNumerical, Leutbecher_2019_EnsembleSizeHow}.
% Thus, numerically solving such stochastic systems -- potentially with data-based terms -- is often computationally expensive, and does not necessarily provide conceptual insight into how the model uncertainties affect predictions.
% Clearly, possessing a broader theoretical understanding of how stochastic terms impact continuous dynamical systems would be valuable.
% Often, the uncertainty in a system is expected to be small, but can have a significant impact on predictions from the model and must therefore be accounted for.


% In particular, \citet{Balasuriya_2020_StochasticSensitivityComputable} derived the limiting mean and variance of the noise-scaled deviation, and provided computable expressions in terms of the deterministic flow map and velocity field.
% However, this was restricted to two-dimensional systems and did not characterise the limiting distribution itself.


% {For discussion, my opinions: \\
% 1. Perhaps less focus on DA, stochastic parametrisation as the primary motivators for the paper. These are applications down-the-line but not the main target of this paper. \\
% 2a. I think stochastic sensitivity should come up earlier. "\cite{Balasuriya_2020_StochasticSensitivityComputable} derived the mean and covariance of a mathematical construct, albeit in two physical dimensions only. This paper extends the calculation of SS to arbitrary dimensions and additionally proves that SS is Gaussian" is a nice sentence!\\
% 2b. Consider including something on the Fokker-Planck equation (FPE)---and impossibility of exact solution---and then on the alternatives: simulating SDEs many times or approximations. \\
% 3. Point 2 leads nicely into discussing linearisations. I think you have
% \begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman{*}), ref=(\roman{*})]
%  \item Jazwinski: gives the linearisation but as a Taylor series
%  \item Sanz-Alonso: provides an error bound for the linearisation in terms of the KL divergence, but for additive noise
%  \item Sarkka: \cite[\S5.5]{SarkkaSolin_2019_AppliedStochasticDifferential} gives a general expression for all moments of the sde solution, but one that requires the exact solution to the FPE. \cite[9.1]{SarkkaSolin_2019_AppliedStochasticDifferential} then discusses a \emph{Gaussian assumed density approximation}, that allows calculation of the moments of the sde, but without rigorous justification.

% The contributions of this work are:
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item In \Cref{thm:main}, we provide an explicit bound on the strong error between a stochastic differential equation and an appropriate linearisation, capturing the impact of \emph{both} the ongoing linearisation and the choice of initial condition.
%     This builds upon previous studies of small-noise expansions \cite[e.g.]{Sanz-AlonsoStuart_2017_GaussianApproximationsSmall,Blagoveshchenskii_1962_DiffusionProcessesDepending,FreidlinWentzell_1998_RandomPerturbationsDynamical}, providing an direct proof in the multidimensional, fully-nonautonomous and multiplicative noise case, and an explicit expression for the bound while additionally extending these results to arbitrary initial conditions.
%     Using this bound, we provide conditions for the initialisation of the linearised equation.

% \section{Stochastic parameterisation}\label{sec:stoch_param}


% All methods using this approach have uncertainties in the model specification arising from a variety of sources \cite{FangEtAl_2020_DisentanglingResolutionPrecision}: the model not capturing all phenomena because of the inevitable lack of a complete understanding of all processes involved, errors in measured data, information only available on spatio-temporal grids (resolution error), etc.
% There are generally two manifestations of this uncertainty: in the initial state, and in the ongoing evolution of the model itself.


% In \cref{sec:theory}, we directly bound the expectation of all moments of the distance between the linearisation and the true solution of the stochastic differential equation.
% Our result extends the former convergence result of \citep{Sanz-AlonsoStuart_2017_GaussianApproximationsSmall} in three ways: we predict the scaling of all moments of the error, in the presence of multiplicative noise terms, and including time-dependent coefficients in the stochastic differential equations. We directly compare our results with those of \cite{Sanz-AlonsoStuart_2017_GaussianApproximationsSmall} in \cref{sec:comparison}.
% In \Cref{sec:numerics}, we show numerically that the scaling of the strong error predicted by \Cref{thm:main} matches our predictions on three example SDEs in \(1\)- and \(2\)-dimensions.
% We confirm the predicted scaling for four moments of the error.


% In particular, \citet{SuraEtAl_2005_MultiplicativeNoiseNonGaussianity} demonstrate that linear deterministic dynamics with multiplicative noise can be produce the non-Gaussian statistics that we observed in real systems.


% The mixing effect that these eddies have on the surrounding flow can be modelled with spatiotemporally-varying diffusion \citehere, which via the Fokker-Planck equation can be equivalently formulated as a stochastic differential equation with multiplicative noise.
% The Lagrangian trajectories, incorporating these unresolved eddy effects, are then modelled as solutions to the stochastic differential equation.
% Equivalently, through the Fokker-Planck equation we can consider the evolution of a passive tracer undergoing advection due to the deterministic drift and diffusion from both any natural diffusivity and the unresolved processes.
% The probability density function that solves the Fokker-Planck equation can be instead thought of as a time-varying density (with the appropriate normalisation) of the tracer.
% For instance, the Fokker-Planck equation has been used to model the transport of ??? with a stochastic framework \citehere.
% Hence, understanding the evolution of solutions to a stochastic differential equation is valuable in oceanography, as a means of quantifying both observational error and unresolved subgrid processes.


% There are several different methods for quantifying eddy diffusivity given either observed tracer data or a global ocean circulation model.

% The simplest notion of eddy diffusivity is a defined by






% A recent approach by \cite{YingEtAl_2019_BayesianInferenceOcean} uses Bayesian inference to estimate the eddy diffusivity tensor from observed Lagrangian tracer data, by numerically solving the Fokker-Planck equation to compute a likelihood function.


% In summary, stochastic parameterisation



% \section{Limitations of stochastic simulation and the need for further development}\label{sec:bkg_sim_limits}
% The introduction of stochastic terms complicates both the analytical treatment of the model.
% For example, we saw in \Cref{sec:sde_theory} that adding even additive and stationary\lb{Is this the right word?? I mean that \(\sigma\) is constant, with no time-dependency}\td{need to define additive versus multiplicative properly.} noise to an analytically solvable non-linear deterministic model can make exact solutions intractable.
% Thus, across many applications the state of the art approach is to generate samples of the stochastic model and perform statistical inference.
% For example, Monte-Carlo simulation is used across weather forecasting \citep{LeutbecherEtAl_2017_StochasticRepresentationsModel}, \td{something atmospheric} and \td{something oceanic}.

% However, the most significant drawback of bulk stochastic simulation is the computational load.
% In general, a large number of samples is required for convergent statistics and accurate inference, as discussed by \citet{Leutbecher_2019_EnsembleSizeHow}.
% For a complex model, the computational load of computing a single realisation

% The recent review by \citet{LeutbecherEtAl_2017_StochasticRepresentationsModel} highlights the need to develop computationally efficient schemes for quantifying stochasticity in weather and climate forecast models.


% \td{Show the plateauing out that I am observing empirically when using a KDE . . . some literature on this?? This is a huge point to make}
% For example, suppose that we intend on using the probabilistic forecast of our stochastic model in an inference scheme, such as in data assimilation in which model predictions are combined with ongoing observations to produce an improved forecast \cite[e.g.]{LawEtAl_2015_DataAssimilationMathematical,BudhirajaEtAl_2019_AssimilatingDataModels, ReichCotter_2015_ProbabilisticForecastingBayesian}.
% This requires a probability density function or similar for our forecast, but in generating samples we initially only have a collection of finite discrete points.


% The purpose of this example was to highlight the importance of accounting for measurement error and unresolved processes in a ; when the dynamics are complicated, then any uncertainty can have a significant impact on our inferences from the model, both quantitatively and qualitatively.


% The second contribution of the paper is to % In the context of two-dimensional, unsteady fluid flow, stochastic sensitivity works with Eulerian velocity data as the underlying deterministic model, and seeks to quantify the uncertainty in an eventual Lagrangian trajectory location.
% This methodology was originally developed by Balasuriya \cite{Balasuriya_2020_StochasticSensitivityComputable} as a tool for determining Lagrangian coherent structures (LCS) \cite{BalasuriyaEtAl_2018_GeneralizedLagrangianCoherent,HadjighasemEtAl_2017_CriticalComparisonLagrangian} in fluid flows, in that clusters of trajectories which have small uncertainty may be thought of as more ``coherent'' than others.
% In \Cref{sec:theory_s2}, we generalise the (formerly two-dimensional) stochastic sensitivity to arbitrary dimensions by proving that the stochastic sensitivity can be computed as the largest eigenvalue of the covariance matrix of the solution to the linearised equation from \cref{sec:theory}.
% Our expressions extend \cite{Balasuriya_2020_StochasticSensitivityComputable} by empowering a rapid computation of stochastic sensitivity, as previously the computation required three integrals of particular rotations of the gradient of the flow map.
% We demonstrate this computation in \cref{sec:comput_s2}.
