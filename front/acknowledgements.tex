To my closest friends (to follow a clich\'e, you all know who you are), .

All of the maths HDRs made working on this project a blast, but I reserve particular gratitude for the Level 7 gang: Clover Hoffman, George Savvoudis, Irulan Murphy, Kai Li, Matthew Drown, Saka Magsarjav, Steven Greenwood, and Wills Nguyen.



I also want to thank all the legends within the ATCA teams at the Adelaide University Cricket Club, who will almost surely never read this monstrosity but provided an incredibly valuable escape from it at trainings and during our matches.

Finally, to my parents Alison and Stephen, and my grandmother Margaret, for their ongoing love and support.
