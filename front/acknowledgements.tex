\chapter{Acknowledgements}
\label{ch:acknowledgements}

First and foremost, I give the uttermost gratitude to my two supervisors, Sanjeeva Balasuriya and Jack Maclean.
Our meetings were always interesting and enjoyable and they have always had the utmost patience and reassurance for my many worries.
I have learnt so much from their unique approaches to research and always have valued their advice on both academia and my broader life and career.

All the maths HDRs made working on this project a blast, but I reserve particular gratitude for the Level 7 gang: Clover Hoffman, George Savvoudis, Irulan Murphy, Kai Li, Matthew Drown, Saka Magsarjav, Steven Greenwood, and Wills Nguyen.

I also want to thank all the legends within the ATCA teams at the Adelaide University Cricket Club, who will almost surely never read this work but provided an incredibly valuable escape from it at trainings and during our matches.

To my closest friends (to follow a clich\'e, you all should know who you are), thank you for all the coffees, the lunches, the boardgames, the runs, and the drinks.
All these moments went a long way to keeping me sane.

Finally, to my parents Alison and Stephen, and my grandmother Margaret, thank you always for your ongoing love and support.
