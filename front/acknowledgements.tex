\chapter{Acknowledgements}
\label{ch:acknowledgements}

First and foremost, I give the uttermost gratitude to my two supervisors, Sanjeeva Balasuriya and Jack Maclean.
Our meetings were always interesting and enjoyable and throughout they had the utmost patience and reassurance for my many worries.
Sanjeeva was a
Jack provided but also a realism that helped keep us all in check.
They both made this work fun and I learnt so much about research from their unique approaches.

All of the maths HDRs made working on this project a blast, but I reserve particular gratitude for the Level 7 gang: Clover Hoffman, George Savvoudis, Irulan Murphy, Kai Li, Matthew Drown, Saka Magsarjav, Steven Greenwood, and Wills Nguyen.

I also want to thank all the legends within the ATCA teams at the Adelaide University Cricket Club, who will almost surely never read this disquisition but provided an incredibly valuable escape from it at trainings and during our matches.

To my closest friends (to follow a clich\'e, you all should know who you are), thank you for all the coffees, the boardgames, the runs, and the drinks.
All these moments went a long way to keeping me sane.

Finally, to my parents Alison and Stephen, and my grandmother Margaret, thank you always for your ongoing love and support.
