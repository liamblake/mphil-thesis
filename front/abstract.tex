Differential equations are used ubiquitously across many different fields to predict and understand phenomena around us.
These are inevitably subject to uncertainties arising from a range of source, including
Accounting for these uncertainties leads to a better model, but are analytically challenging and often require expensive Monte-Carlo simulation.
In this thesis, we are interested in stochastic differential equations, which are a natural extension of ordinary differential equations that parameterise uncertainty with a noise process that contributes to the ongoing evolution of solutions.
We look to address the need for computationally efficient methods that characterise uncertainty without resorting to the expensive alternative of bulk simulation.


In characterising this limit, we are also able to provide theoretical and computational extension of stochastic sensitivity (Balasuriya), a recently developed tool for characterising the impact of uncertainty on differential equation solution.
Stochastic sensitivity was previously restricted to two-dimensions, which we are able to overcome.

To further the linearisation framework, we also propose an \emph{ad hoc} algorithm for approximating the solution to an SDE

Our initial investigation into this algorithm on predicting the position of a drifter in the Gulf Stream gave promising results, motivating future development and investigation.
