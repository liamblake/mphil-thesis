\chapter{Extending stochastic sensitivity}

There are several shortcomings of \cite{Balasuriya_2020_StochasticSensitivityComputable} that warrant further extension, namely:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item The tools are restricted to two-dimensional models, and the constructions using projections have no obvious extension to \(n\)-dimensions.
	      Extending stochastic sensitivity to \(n\)-dimensions will enable application to a much broader class of models beyond the fluid flow context, including high-dimensional climate and ??? models.

	\item \cite{Balasuriya_2020_StochasticSensitivityComputable} only computes the expectation and variance of the projections \(P_\epsilon(x,\theta)\), which does not give us the distribution under the limit as \(\epsilon\) approaches 0.

	\item
\end{enumerate}
