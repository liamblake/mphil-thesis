  abstract = {Uncertainties in velocity data are often ignored when computing Lagrangian particle trajectories of fluids. Modelling these as noise in the velocity field leads to a random deviation from each trajectory. This deviation is examined within the context of small (multiplicative) stochasticity applying to a two-dimensional unsteady flow operating over a finite-time. These assumptions are motivated precisely by standard availability expectations of realistic velocity data. Explicit expressions for the deviation's expected size and anisotropy are obtained using an It\^o calculus approach, thereby characterizing the uncertainty in the Lagrangian trajectory's final location with respect to lengthscale and direction. These provide a practical methodology for ascribing spatially nonuniform uncertainties to predictions of flows, and new tools for extracting fluid regions which remain robust under velocity fluctuations.}

  abstract = {The ultimate objective of this book is to present a panoramic view of the main stochastic processes which have an impact on applications, with complete proofs and exercises. Random processes play a central role in the applied sciences, including operations research, insurance, finance, biology, physics, computer and communications networks, and signal processing. In order to help the reader to reach a level of technical autonomy sufficient to understand the presented models, this book includes a reasonable dose of probability theory. On the other hand, the study of stochastic processes gives an opportunity to apply the main theoretical results of probability theory beyond classroom examples and in a non-trivial manner that makes this discipline look more attractive to the applications-oriented student. One can distinguish three parts of this book. The first four chapters are about probability theory, Chapters 5 to 8 concern random sequences, or discrete-time stochastic processes, and the rest of the book focuses on stochastic processes and point processes. There is sufficient modularity for the instructor or the self-teaching reader to design a course or a study program adapted to her/his specific needs. This book is in a large measure self-contained.},

  abstract = {"Stochastic Analysis and Diffusion Processes presents a simple, mathematical introduction to Stochastic Calculus and its applications. The book builds the basic theory and offers a careful account of important research directions in Stochastic Analysis. The breadth and power of Stochastic Analysis, and probabilistic behavior of diffusion processes are told without compromising on the mathematical details. Starting with the construction of stochastic processes, the book introduces Brownian motion and martingales. The book proceeds to construct stochastic integrals, establish the It\^o formula, and discuss its applications. Next, attention is focused on stochastic differential equations (SDEs) which arise in modeling physical phenomena, perturbed by random forces. Diffusion processes are solutions of SDEs and form the main theme of this book. The Stroock-Varadhan martingale problem, the connection between diffusion processes and partial differential equations, Gaussian solutions of SDEs, and Markov processes with jumps are presented in successive chapters. The book culminates with a careful treatment of important research topics such as invariant measures, ergodic behavior, and large deviation principle for diffusions. Examples are given throughout the book to illustrate concepts and results. In addition, exercises are given at the end of each chapter that will help the reader to understand the concepts better. The book is written for graduate students, young researchers and applied scientists who are interested in stochastic processes and their applications. The reader is assumed to be familiar with probability theory at graduate level. The book can be used as a text for a graduate course on Stochastic Analysis." --},
