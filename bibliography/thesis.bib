  abstract = {{$<$}!-- *** Custom HTML *** --{$><$}p{$>$}This Note discusses a connection between deterministic Lagrangian coherent structures (robust fluid parcels which move coherently in unsteady fluid flows according to a deterministic ordinary differential equation), and the incorporation of noise or stochasticity which leads to the Fokker\textendash Planck equation (a partial differential equation governing a probability density function). The link between these is via a stochastic ordinary differential equation. It is argued that a closer investigation of the stochastic differential equation offers additional insights to both the other approaches, and in particular to uncertainty quantification in Lagrangian coherent structures.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Uncertainties in velocity data are often ignored when computing Lagrangian particle trajectories of fluids. Modelling these as noise in the velocity field leads to a random deviation from each trajectory. This deviation is examined within the context of small (multiplicative) stochasticity applying to a two-dimensional unsteady flow operating over a finite-time. These assumptions are motivated precisely by standard availability expectations of realistic velocity data. Explicit expressions for the deviation's expected size and anisotropy are obtained using an It\^o calculus approach, thereby characterizing the uncertainty in the Lagrangian trajectory's final location with respect to lengthscale and direction. These provide a practical methodology for ascribing spatially nonuniform uncertainties to predictions of flows, and new tools for extracting fluid regions which remain robust under velocity fluctuations.}

  abstract = {The notion of a Lagrangian Coherent Structure (LCS) is by now well established as a way to capture transient coherent transport dynamics in unsteady and aperiodic fluid flows that are known over finite time. We show that the concept of an LCS can be generalized to capture coherence in other quantities of interest that are transported by, but not fully locked to, the fluid. Such quantities include those with dynamic, biological, chemical, or thermodynamic relevance, such as temperature, pollutant concentration, vorticity, kinetic energy, plankton density, and so on. We provide a conceptual framework for identifying the Generalized Lagrangian Coherent Structures (GLCSs) associated with such evolving quantities. We show how LCSs can be seen as a special case within this framework, and provide an overarching discussion of various methods for identifying LCSs. The utility of this more general viewpoint is highlighted through a variety of examples. We also show that although LCSs approximate GLCSs in certain limiting situations under restrictive assumptions on how the velocity field affects the additional quantities of interest, LCSs are not in general sufficient to describe their coherent transport.},

  abstract = {We consider the situation of a large-scale stationary flow subjected to small-scale fluctuations. Assuming that the stable and unstable manifolds of the large-scale flow are known, we quantify the mean behavior and stochastic fluctuations of particles close to the unperturbed stable and unstable manifolds and their evolution in time. The mean defines a smooth curve in physical space, while the variance provides a time- and space-dependent quantitative estimate where particles are likely to be found. This allows us to quantify transport properties such as the expected volume of mixing as the result of the stochastic fluctuations of the transport barriers. We corroborate our analytical findings with numerical simulations in both compressible and incompressible flow situations. We moreover demonstrate the intimate connection of our results with finite-time Lyapunov exponent fields, and with spatial mixing regions.},

  abstract = {The ultimate objective of this book is to present a panoramic view of the main stochastic processes which have an impact on applications, with complete proofs and exercises. Random processes play a central role in the applied sciences, including operations research, insurance, finance, biology, physics, computer and communications networks, and signal processing. In order to help the reader to reach a level of technical autonomy sufficient to understand the presented models, this book includes a reasonable dose of probability theory. On the other hand, the study of stochastic processes gives an opportunity to apply the main theoretical results of probability theory beyond classroom examples and in a non-trivial manner that makes this discipline look more attractive to the applications-oriented student. One can distinguish three parts of this book. The first four chapters are about probability theory, Chapters 5 to 8 concern random sequences, or discrete-time stochastic processes, and the rest of the book focuses on stochastic processes and point processes. There is sufficient modularity for the instructor or the self-teaching reader to design a course or a study program adapted to her/his specific needs. This book is in a large measure self-contained.},

  abstract = {"Stochastic Analysis and Diffusion Processes presents a simple, mathematical introduction to Stochastic Calculus and its applications. The book builds the basic theory and offers a careful account of important research directions in Stochastic Analysis. The breadth and power of Stochastic Analysis, and probabilistic behavior of diffusion processes are told without compromising on the mathematical details. Starting with the construction of stochastic processes, the book introduces Brownian motion and martingales. The book proceeds to construct stochastic integrals, establish the It\^o formula, and discuss its applications. Next, attention is focused on stochastic differential equations (SDEs) which arise in modeling physical phenomena, perturbed by random forces. Diffusion processes are solutions of SDEs and form the main theme of this book. The Stroock-Varadhan martingale problem, the connection between diffusion processes and partial differential equations, Gaussian solutions of SDEs, and Markov processes with jumps are presented in successive chapters. The book culminates with a careful treatment of important research topics such as invariant measures, ergodic behavior, and large deviation principle for diffusions. Examples are given throughout the book to illustrate concepts and results. In addition, exercises are given at the end of each chapter that will help the reader to understand the concepts better. The book is written for graduate students, young researchers and applied scientists who are interested in stochastic processes and their applications. The reader is assumed to be familiar with probability theory at graduate level. The book can be used as a text for a graduate course on Stochastic Analysis." --},
